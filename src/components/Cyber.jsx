                In the rapidly evolving field of cybersecurity, there is a
                common misconception that coding skills are a prerequisite for
                success.

                8 Different Types of Cybersecurity and Threats Involved
              </Card.Title>
              <Card.Text>
                Cybersecurity refers to the protection of devices, processes,
                infrastructure, and assets of the organization from
                cyberattacks, data theft, breaches, unauthorized access, etc.
                With the advent of technology and the increasing
                interconnectedness of organizational systems and networks,
                effective cybersecurity management and strategy are necessary
                for organizations of all sizes and types accordingly.
                Investments are flowing into this field and the market is
                projected to be a staggering 403 billion US dollars by 2027.
                This in turn has led to a spurt in demand for experts in the
                field of cyber security. Cybersecurity is an umbrella term that
                encompasses different types of security. In this article, we’re
                trying to deconstruct various types of cybersecurity. So let’s
                dig in.

                There is something fascinating about a lone hacker in black
                hoodies using a single system and their skills to take down big
                corporations and their crony capitalism. The anecdote of a
                hacker has cultivated an ethos of individuality, corporate
                freedom, and distinct craftiness that can’t be denied. Also, the
                same archetype is visible in a number of pop-cultural references
                whether the famous TV series- Mr. Robot or real-life adaptations
                of Snowden and Julian Assange. Despite all the fascination of
                hacking, and hysteria, the field of cybersecurity is largely
                misunderstood outside of the realm of the IT ecosystem.

              <Card.Text>
                Many people ask how important is coding for cybersecurity, and
                the lawyerly answer is: Well, it depends on many facets. Because
                just starting off, many roles don’t really require you to code
                and based on how advanced you want to get, programming may or
                may not be all that important for you.
